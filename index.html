In the field of biomedical engineering, prosthetics or artificial limbs allow amputees to regain function resulting 
from the loss or absence of a limb. Prosthetic joint infections (PJI) have increased in frequency even though the 
infection risk after primary hip and knee arthroplasties is less than 2%. (Bernard et al., 2010). More patients are 
having surgery and it has been shown that he hip and knee joints are the most often replaced joints. Rheumatoid arthritis, 
osteoarthritis, and other degenerative and inflammatory diseases, as well as traumatic joint injuries, are the three 
main causes of joint replacement. The piano and PSAT study are both examples of how antibiotic therapy can help in the 
management of prosthetic joint infection. (Davis et al., 2022). The percentage of infections that were polymicrobial 
differed significantly between presentation types in the results of the PIANO study, proving that the type of infection 
and the timing of the presentation in relation to the original implant date should be used to determine which antibiotic 
is best. (Davis et al., 2022). Blood culture bottles are a new method of detecting infection in prosthetic joints which
is more accurate and less time-consuming.

Prosthetic limbs are classified according to the level of amputation: above the knee, below the knee, above the elbow, 
and below the elbow. (Lenz, 2021). For example, when performing a total knee arthroplasty, the surgeon will cut down
the front of the patients’ knee, allowing the kneecap to move to move to the side so they can get to the knee joint 
behind it. (Lenz, 2021). In order to create a new joint, the patient's damaged shin and thigh bones are surgically cut 
away. New parts, typically made of plastic and metal, are then fitted over the ends of both bones. (Lenz, 2021).

The results of the Prosthetic Joint infection in Australia and New Zealand Observational (PIANO) study collected data from 27 
hospitals and 738 cases of prosthetic joint infections (PJI). The study was used to determine how effective different empiric 
intravenous antibiotic regimens would be best suited to cure PJI according to duration of symptoms after the initial prosthesis 
placement. (Davis et al., 2022) An empiric antimicrobial regimen is used before the organism causing the presence of an infection
is known whereas a definitive regimen is instituted where the causative organism is known. (McGraw Hill Medical, 2023). The patients
in the study were put into categories shown in this figure below.      

Another study was performed consisting of 26 patients with prosthetic joint infection following total knee arthroplasty with the
aim of the study to describe the effectiveness of antibiotic suppression therapy (PSAT)(Sandiford et al., 2019). Antibiotic suppression
treatment refers to the long-term, sometimes lifetime use of antibiotics to prevent joint-related sepsis episodes, alleviate symptoms, 
and delay or avoid the need for further surgery (Sandiford et al., 2019). Patients with PJI were given 6 weeks of intravenous (IV) 
antibiotic therapy following surgery. After they were given 6 weeks oral antibiotic therapy. This determined that PSAT would be defined 
as an oral antibiotic therapy occurring after the 12 weeks as a lifelong treatment (Sandiford et al., 2019). The main goal of the study 
was to document the PSAT success rate, which was defined as the absence of sepsis-related hospital admissions, surgical progression, or
mortality from associated reasons. The second goal of the study was to measure the complication rates of PSAT which included any adverse 
reactions to the antibiotic used (Sandiford et al., 2019).

The results from the PIANO cohort revealed that in all three presentation types, early post-operative, late acute and chronic, 
Staphylococcusaureus was the most prevalent pathogen. (Davis et al., 2022). The proportion of polymicrobial infections varied 
considerably amongst presentation types. Polymicrobial infections are caused by more than one type of microbe and may be 
complex, synergistic, or concurrent. (Brogden, 2003)      

In this investigation, PSAT was successfully discontinued in both individuals after one and one and a half years; the infections were 
related to Staph. aureus (1 polymicrobial, 1 MSSA). At the time of the last follow-up, the patients in two cases in which no organisms 
could be found (no growth) were still symptom-free.

    <pre>
The data from both of the set of results show that the most suitable antibiotic depends on the timing of the presentation relative 
to the initial implant date and type of infection and that there is no singular antibiotic that should be used to cure the prosthetic 
joint infection. This can be supported by the fact that polymicrobial infections was more common in the early post-operative infection 
but uncommon in late acute infection in the Piano cohort.       

The majority of PJI diagnosis techniques take a long time and require multiple pre- and intraoperative processes for example primary 
total joint arthroplasties (TJAs) which have a higher risk of infections and blood clots. (Baldini et al., 2015). Blood culture bottles 
(BCBs) is new method of detection of prosthetic joint infections which are used to detect the presence of infection-causing pathogens in 
the circulating blood and result in fewer false positives. (Sanabria et al., 2019). Usually, several blood samples are drawn from various 
veins in an effort to improve the likelihood of finding the bacteria or fungi in your blood. (Krans, 2018) Blood culture bottles are more 
efficient than traditional methods of diagnosing prosthetic joint infections such as a plain radiograph. For example, the images are two-dimensional, 
black-and-white depictions of disease, and their interpretation is inherently subjective, which is frequently seen as a cause of inaccuracy. 
(Alexander, 2010) 

A prospective laboratory study was conducted in the University Hospital of North Norway which, 46 out of 158 prosthetic joint tissue (PJT) 
specimens belonging to 24/62 (38.7%) patients had microorganisms detected by BCBs. (Sanabria et al., 2019)

    <pre>
In conclusion, the timing of presentation in relation to the original implant date affects the microbial aetiology of pressure injuries (PJI),
and treatment regimens based on empirical antibiotics should be customised for each patient. (Davis et al., 2022). The blood culture systems are 
more effective and quicker at detecting a larger variety of bacteria than the traditional microbiological approach. (Sanabria et al., 2019).
