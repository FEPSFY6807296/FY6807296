In the field of biomedical engineering, prosthetics or artificial limbs allow amputees to regain function resulting 
from the loss or absence of a limb. Prosthetic joint infections (PJI) have increased in frequency even though the 
infection risk after primary hip and knee arthroplasties is less than 2%. (Bernard et al., 2010). This is because 
more patients are having surgery. The hip and knee joints are the most often replaced joints. Rheumatoid arthritis, 
osteoarthritis, and other degenerative and inflammatory diseases, as well as traumatic joint injuries, are the three 
main causes of joint replacement. The piano and PSAT study are both examples of how antibiotic therapy can help in the 
management of prosthetic joint infection. (Davis et al., 2022). The percentage of infections that were polymicrobial 
differed significantly between presentation types in the results of the PIANO study, proving that the type of infection 
and the timing of the presentation in relation to the original implant date should be used to determine which antibiotic 
is best. (Davis et al., 2022). Blood culture bottles are a new method of detecting infection in prosthetic joints which
is more accurate and less time-consuming.

Prosthetic limbs are classified according to the level of amputation: above the knee, below the knee, above the elbow, 
and below the elbow. (Lenz, 2021). For example, when performing a total knee arthroplasty, the surgeon will cut down
the front of the patients’ knee, allowing the kneecap to move to move to the side so they can get to the knee joint 
behind it. (Lenz, 2021). The damaged ends of the patient’s shin bone and thigh bone are cut away, allowing new parts 
which are usually made of plastic and metal to be fitted over the ends of both bones creating the new joint. (Lenz, 2021).
